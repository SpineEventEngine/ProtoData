/**
 * An arbitrary piece of Java code.
 *
 * This class is the default implementation of [JavaElement].
 *
 * When defining a Java element with the [code] property, avoid leading spaces,
 * tab indents, or new lines. Many elements are converted to PSI counterparts,
 * which often prohibit leading whitespaces.
 *
 * Handling multiline strings:
 *
 * - Use `trimIndent()` for **literal** Kotlin multiline strings:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   val element = AnElement(
 *       """
 *       int x = 42;
 *       int y = 32;
 *       """.trimIndent()
 *   )
 *   ```
 *
 * - For **interpolated** or **concatenated** strings, prefer `trim()`:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   val point = """
 *       int x = 42;
 *       int y = 32;
 *   """.trimIndent()
 *   val element = AnElement(
 *       """
 *       $point
 *       System.out.println(x);
 *       System.out.println(y);
 *       """.trim()
 *   )
 *   ```
 *   `trimIndent()` will fail here, as dynamic content affects indentation detection.
 *
 * Some subclasses may accept [code] with leading spacesâ€”if so, they must document it.
 *
 * @param code Java code without leading whitespaces.
