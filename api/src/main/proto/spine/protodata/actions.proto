// A collection of code generation actions associated with the parameters passed to these actions.
//
// Some code generation scenarios may be solved by applying combination of render actions.
// For example, we want to make messages declared in proto files named `command.proto`
// implement the `CommandMessage` interface, and messages declared in files named `event.proto`
// implement the `EventMessage` interface. Implementation will involve the following steps:
//
//  1) Create a render action called `ImplementInterface`. The action would accept the name
//     of the interface as the parameter.
//  2) Create Protobuf type for settings that would match a file pattern with the action and
//     the corresponding parameter with the name of the interface.
//  3) Create a ProtoData plugin with a renderer which would load the settings and
//     run corresponding actions.
//
// This type addresses the need #2 above, for having parameterised rendering actions in settings
// passed to ProtoData plugins.
//
// Code generation actions listed in this collection serve the same programming language and
// are applied to Protobuf declarations of the same kind. For example, we may have actions
// serving code generation in Java for certain `MessageType`s.
//
// @see io.spine.protodata.renderer.RenderAction
// @see io.spine.tools.code.Language
// @see io.spine.protodata.ProtoDeclaration

    //
    // The types, names of which come as the keys in the map, must serve the same
    // programming language and the same type of Protobuf declaration.
    // The instances of actions are created reflectively. If the above rule is not
    // followed a runtime action will occur during creation of an action.
    //
    // The type of the parameter wrapped into `Any` must match the type of
    // the parameter accepted by the action. Otherwise, a runtime error will occur.
    //
    // If the action does not accept a parameter, the map entry value may contain
    // either a default instance of `Any` or a packed instance of `Empty`.
