/**
 * A [Renderer] which adds [InsertionPoint]s to the code.
 *
 * Insertion points help the developers of other `Renderer`s by marking up source files for easier
 * code insertion. This way, it's only required to parse the file's contents once â€” in
 * an `InsertionPointPrinter`. The job of other `Renderer`s would be to insert their code into
 * pre-prepared insertion points.
 *
 * By default, there are no insertion points in the code files. To add some, create a subtype
 * of `InsertionPointPrinter` and add it to your processing as a first `Renderer`. Note that
 * the `InsertionPointPrinter`s need to be invoked before the other `Renderers`.
