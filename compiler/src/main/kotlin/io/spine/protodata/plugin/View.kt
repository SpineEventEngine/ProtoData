/**
 * A view on the Protobuf sources.
 *
 * A view helps prepare and re-organize data so that code generation may easily access it.
 *
 * A state of a view is defined via Protobuf. The first field of the state must be the ID of
 * the view. Example:
 * ```protobuf
 * import "spine/options.proto";
 * import "spine/protodata/ast.proto";
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * message ShortFieldName {
 *     option (entity).kind = PROJECTION; // Shows that this is a view state.
 *
 *     spine.protodata.FieldName name = 1; // Also, the ID of the view.
 *
 *     spine.protodata.TypeName where_declared = 2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The Java class representing the `ShortFieldName` message must implement [EntityState].
 * The `(entity)` option ensures that is the case.
 *
 * The state of a view is constructed based on events, which are produced either by
 * the Protobuf Compiler or by a [Policy].
 *
 * To listen to the events, define single parameter methods annotated with
 * [@Subscribe][io.spine.core.Subscribe]. In these methods, change the state of the view via
 * the `builder()`, `update { }`, or `alter { }` methods.
 *
 * We recommend to use `internal` access for the subscriber methods in Kotlin and package-private â€”
 * in Java. The methods are not `private`, as they are invoked by the framework, and not `public`,
 * as they must not be called directly.
 *
 * Events from the Protobuf compiler should be marked as [@External][io.spine.core.External], while
 * events from policies should not. See the whole list of Protobuf compiler events
 * in `spine/protodata/events.proto`.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * class MyView : View<FieldName, ShortFieldName, ShortFieldName.Builder> {
 *
 *     @Subscribe
 *     internal fun on(event: SomethingHappened) {
 *         // Change the view via `builder()`.
 *     }
 *
 *     @Subscribe
 *     internal fun on(@External event: FieldOptionDiscovered) {
 *         // Change the view via `builder()`.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Views have repositories which are responsible for storing states and for delivering correct
 * events to the correct views. See [ViewRepository] for more.
 *
 * @param I the type of the ID of the view; can be a Protobuf message, a String, an int, or a long
 * @param M the type of the view's state; must be a Protobuf message implementing [EntityState]
 * @param B the type of the view's state builder; must match `<M>`

/**
 * A repository responsible for a certain type of [View]s.
 *
 * By default, when an event is headed towards a [View], we try to match the first field of
 * the event with the ID of the view. This is called routing. If the types match, the event is
 * routed to the view with the matching ID. Otherwise, an error occurs.
 *
 * To change the rules of event routing, override the [ViewRepository.setupEventRouting] method.
 *
 * If no customization is required from a `ViewRepository`, users should prefer
 * [ViewRepository.default] to creating custom repository types.
